Hi, I'm Dennis!

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Basel. My research area is Statistical Shape Models (SSMs) and their usage within automatic image analysis. 

I have a PhD and a MSc in Computer Science from the University of Basel and a BSc in Electrical Engineering from Aarhus University. 

I've previously worked nearly 10 years within the Wind Power industry, doing everything from hardware design, developing test systems, low-level controller software, web-applications for automatic documentation creation and in the field software acceptance test.

I like challenging myself and acquiring new skill sets, for instance by tutoring classes or attending coding hackathons.
