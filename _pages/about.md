Hi, Iâ€™m Dennis!

I am a dedicated Machine Learning Engineer who can take projects from raw data to full operation and continuous monitoring. I have a Ph.D. and an M.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics, specializing in computer vision and computer graphics, and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering. 

My focus is on real-world machine-learning applications that add value. I am keen on classical computer vision and machine learning methods, probabilistic methods, and generative models. 

My research interest is in automatic image analysis, specifically in probabilistic methods such as Statistical Shape Models (SSMs) and their practical usage.

I am a continuous learner who likes new challenges and acquiring new skills, e.g., through lecturing, pitch competitions, coding hackathons, and video creation.
